                    <div class="article-body">
                        <p class="lead">The modern era of cryptography begins with Claude Shannon, widely regarded as the father of mathematical cryptography. In 1949 he published <em>Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems</em> in the <em>Bell System Technical Journal</em>, followed shortly by the book <em>Mathematical Theory of Communication</em> with Warren Weaver. These works, together with Shannon&rsquo;s broader contributions to information theory, established the theoretical foundations of both cryptography and cryptanalysis, clarifying what &ldquo;secrecy&rdquo; means and how to reason about it rigorously.</p>

                        <p>In the late 1960s and 1970s, public (non-classified) progress accelerated. IBM proposed the <strong>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</strong> as a practical block cipher for securing electronic communications in industry and finance. After review and modifications advised by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), DES was adopted by the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). It became the first widely available encryption algorithm endorsed by a national authority, sparking significant public and academic interest.</p>

                        <p>DES and its stronger variants (such as <strong>Triple DES</strong>, or 3DES) remained in wide use for decades. However, DES&rsquo;s 56-bit key length proved too small against growing computational power and brute-force attacks. This led to the search for a replacement, culminating in the <strong>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</strong>, selected by NIST in 2001 from the Rijndael algorithm designed by two Belgian cryptographers. Today, DES is considered insecure for new systems, while AES is the de-facto standard for modern symmetric encryption.</p>

                        <h2>Asymmetric (Public-Key) Cryptography</h2>
                        <p>A pivotal breakthrough arrived with Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman&rsquo;s 1976 paper <em>New Directions in Cryptography</em>. They introduced a radically new approach to key establishment, now known as the <strong>Diffie&ndash;Hellman key exchange</strong>, and opened the door to a new class of algorithms: <strong>asymmetric (public-key) cryptography</strong>.</p>

                        <p>Before this, practical ciphers were <strong>symmetric-key</strong>: the same secret key was used for both encryption and decryption. The core challenge was <em>key distribution</em>: each pair of communicators needed to share a secret in advance, which does not scale and is operationally fragile when participants are many or keys must be rotated frequently.</p>

                        <p>In asymmetric cryptography, each user has a mathematically related <strong>key pair</strong>: a <strong>public key</strong> (which can be shared) and a <strong>private key</strong> (kept secret). Many but not all public-key systems have the property that knowing the public key does not feasibly reveal the private key with any method currently known. This enables anyone to encrypt to a recipient using the recipient&rsquo;s public key, while only the recipient can decrypt using their private key. The same mathematical structure also enables <strong>digital signatures</strong>, where a private key produces a signature that anyone can verify with the corresponding public key.</p>

                        <p>Crucially, a single public/private key pair can serve many senders: possession of a recipient&rsquo;s public key does not compromise security, and no per-pair shared secret is required. This surprising property made secure communication at Internet scale both possible and practical.</p>

                        <h2>Definitions and Core Concepts</h2>

                        <h3>Cryptology, Cryptography, and Cryptanalysis</h3>
                        <p><strong>Cryptology</strong> is the overarching science of secure communication and consists of two branches: <strong>cryptography</strong> (the design and use of systems that protect information) and <strong>cryptanalysis</strong> (the study and practice of breaking or evaluating those systems). Cryptanalysis is essential to validate security claims; without it, cryptography would be untested theory.</p>

                        <h3>Symmetric-Key Algorithms</h3>
                        <p><strong>Symmetric</strong> algorithms use the same (or trivially related) keys for encryption and decryption. They are typically fast, use comparatively small keys, and are best suited for encrypting large volumes of data (e.g., storage encryption, VPN tunnels). The main drawback is key distribution and management: all communicating parties must securely share the same secret key.</p>

                        <h3>Asymmetric (Public-Key) Algorithms</h3>
                        <p><strong>Asymmetric</strong> or <strong>public-key</strong> algorithms use key pairs and rely on so-called <em>one-way functions</em> &mdash; mathematical problems easy to compute in one direction but infeasible to invert without special knowledge (the private key). Anyone can encrypt to a public key, but only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt. Public-key cryptography also underpins digital signatures, certificate infrastructures, and secure boot chains.</p>

                        <h3>Cryptographic Protocols</h3>
                        <p><strong>Protocols</strong> specify how cryptographic algorithms are combined and used in the real world, handling negotiation, authentication, replay protection, and more. <strong>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</strong>, used by every modern web browser, is a prime example: it orchestrates asymmetric key exchange, certificate validation, symmetric encryption, and message authentication to provide confidentiality and integrity for Internet traffic.</p>

                        <h3>Hash Functions</h3>
                        <p>A <strong>cryptographic hash function</strong> maps input of arbitrary length to a fixed-length output called a <em>hash</em> (or <em>digest</em>). Good hash functions are deterministic, collision-resistant, and preimage-resistant. In practice, hashes support integrity checks, digital signatures, password storage (with salts and slow schemes), and data deduplication. In protocols, message authentication often combines hashing with a secret (e.g., HMAC) to detect tampering.</p>

                        <h2>Building Blocks in Modern Secure Channels</h2>
<pre><code class="language-bash">// High-level building blocks in modern secure channels
// 1) Key Agreement (e.g., Diffie&ndash;Hellman) -&gt; shared secret
// 2) KDF (Key Derivation Function) -&gt; symmetric keys
// 3) Symmetric Encryption (e.g., AES-GCM) -&gt; confidentiality + integrity
// 4) Certificates &amp; Signatures (PKI) -&gt; server/client authentication
// 5) Hashing/HMAC -&gt; message integrity, transcript binding</code></pre>
